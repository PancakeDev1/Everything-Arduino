  Everything Arduino is a place to share all of the cool Arduino projects that you make. You are free to publish whatever project you want to, as long as you created it yourself. On the Wiki page, you will find how to set up all of our projects. The Main Code page is where we have the code and other documents for our project, and the projects tab is projects that we are currently working on. If you have any issuses with the code uploaded, please take your time to write an issue report discussing what is wrong. 

Rules:
  If you would like to share any code, please add the creator of the project somewhere in your media. Do not spam documents or post hurtful comments.
